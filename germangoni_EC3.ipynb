    "**Business Context.** You work for AdventureWorks, a company that sells outdoor sporting equipment. The company has many different locations and has been recording the sales of different locations on various products.

    "You have been given access to their database with documentation from the IT department. Your job is to extract meaningful insights from this database to help increase sales. First, you will look at the best products and try to see how different products behave in different categories. Second, you will analyze the best salespeople to see if commission percentage motivates them to sell more.\n",

Using  ```SalesOrderHeader``` (there is a column `SubTotal`) in the ```Sales``` schema, calculate the sales for each salesperson for **this past year** (2014).  Sales that do not have an associated salesperson is assigned an ID of 0; you should exclude this from the results. Limit results to 5 rows and order by descending total sales."

Let us repeat the previous exercise except that we calculate `SubTotal` manually. Using ```SalesOrderDetail``` and ```SalesOrderHeader``` in the ```Sales``` schema, calculate the sales for each salesperson for **this past year** (2014).\n",

    "**Hint:** You will have to ```JOIN``` ```SalesOrderDetail``` on ```SalesOrderHeader``` to get the salesperson, calculate line totals for each sale using appropriate discounts, then sum all the line totals to get the total sale. Limit results to 5 rows and order by descending total sales. You will want to use ```WITH ... AS``` to save subqueries as we will assume that `SubTotal` doesn't exist moving forward."

    "You now just realized that your company is multinational and has offices in different countries around the world. Furthermore, you are told the sales are recorded in the local currency so you must convert it to USD if you wish to compare the different salespeople. Construct a new ```Sales.SalesPerson``` table to include a new column for ```CurrencyCode```. You will have to do this by extracting the `TerritoryID` of the salesperson from ```Sales.SalesTerritory``` then use `CountryRegionCode` in that table to get `CurrencyCode` from ```Sales.CountryRegionCurrency```. This will involve multiple ```JOIN```'s. Limit results to 5 rows."
